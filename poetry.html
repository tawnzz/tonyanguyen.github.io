<div class = "opener" <p> So, this is "poetry." I don't really know what this is actually. I always have a notebook on hand and like to jot down my thoughts. I'll share this little piece of myself with you. </p> </div>

<div class = "poems"> <p> Why don't we dance to the buzz of fluoresence, to the rain on fiery trails, to the taste of roasted barley - stuck in the corner of my lips. I dance on swinging trees, where you won't remember me. I saw flowers blossom despite the dark, and together the petals we plucked and ate. Today, a tender mountain peach rolled down the hill and landed at my feet, as I looked on in defeat with the beat of my heart like falling trees. This feeling will stay and fade, stay and fade, stay and fade. In one, two, three, months time, I surely will change. Is there a difference between hello and goodbye? My mother once told me that love doesn't die, some neural dances stay alive. To memory flowers cry, the petals in notebooks I'll keep, hell, to memory of new memories! I can dance, dance, dance again.</p>

<p> Sadness is the summer I stuck my head into deep water and nearly drowned. A lifeless creature moving upon the floor, its' only purpose was to clean. Feelings like sadness and disorientation come in lulling waves. My knees buck under my weight and I forget how to be half a human when I'm feeling something so clearly, definable, by the damned laws of physics, philosophy, the pedantry of AP Language at sixteen, human. But not all things come in waves, more like "glass pumpkings in a crackling vermillion sea," they push and pull harder than I can anticipate. When I feel that I've hurt you, I am an Egyptian in Exodus. I am seven, nine, fourteen, sixteen, eighteen and three months all over again.

And the urge to clean is so strange. This is not an attempt to fix but all I know is how to fix and to wrap brushed cheeks in bandages. Am I hurting? Who? You? Hurting others? Healing me? Healing you? I'm that creature that cleaned the pool, blue, fun to drag on hot summer days. But. I am expensive and only exist if you can afford some luxury and brave the seasons.</p> 

<p> The smell of ginseng pulling me in, it's the blue glow of the window paneled doors in my mother's room. The red, yelllow, queer, dirt-smeared plastic playground that lived in frames peeking at me through the trasparent tapping. Under blinded eyes, a drunken bird flew through, only to be halted by that illusion of a path. The smell is gone now. Wine rice has such an effect, like a silken sickness that slices like vegan. I ate vegetables that grew taller than me but if we didn't eat them, under my feet they crumbled, crunch, cry, chirp, little birdy, back to life.</p>

<p> The animal of cause lives in full contradiction. It has a self, a no self, recognizes the beauty and importance in the world, even its inherent meaninglessness. Maybe the universe called out my name and 1998 was to blame. I am a linear combination, another trivial transformation of the stars, an ambigous emotion peaking through the curtains, crying out in silent echo. If we are on the same basis, one and the same, then I think I can love myself because I love you. <i> I am the world and you are nothing but a speckle of dirt smeared on the plane of existance. You are the world and I am nothing but a speckle of dirt smeared on the plane of existence. </i> We'll spread and sprawl across speckles of tiny speckles. Die, die, die, again and again. We invite this. Return.</p>

<p> "They love you and they trust you, but only halfway. And they're sure that halfway is more full than it is empty. And they're sorry for intruding into the space of your heart. They're weeds, seeds riding the humming wind, looking for petals to land on â€“ violation. Now there's a field of them, rooted in your memory, friends, family. They can empathize when you say your love someone else. They love eachother and whenever you hurt them, till the shit out of the them, they stay grounded. But why didn't you say so? They didn't know you didn't want to blossom. If that's what you really need, to heal on your own, rip them out of your soil before the love soils. They can try to understand."</p>
