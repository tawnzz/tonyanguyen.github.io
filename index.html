		<center><div>Heyo, it's Tonya! My website is currently under construction. You can learn more about me below! </div></center>
		<div>
			<div> <p>In a nutshell: I'm a 19 year-old designer, thinker, and idealist realist. I'm also a second year Cognitive Science major at UC Berkeley!<div></div>
			</div>

			
		
		<div><p>I run on fresh produce, coffee, and endless laughter. From rebelliously coloring the walls of my parents' first home, writing my own cookbook, to painting in pixels, I've always been a creator. I'm fascinated by the ubiquity, fluidity, and impact of human centered design. Through studying cultures, data structures, and linguistics, I strive to learn more deeply about human-computer interaction and behaviors. With research, activism, and personal investment, I'm determined to design for accessibility and social impact. </p></div>

		<div><p>I love making people laugh, inhaling spicy food, and browsing through fresh produce. For me, learning is a daily routine - I've caught the knowledge bug, so feel free to send me a cool article or research paper! On any day, you can find me <a href="assets/poems.pdf" target="_blank">writing poetry</a>, powerlifting at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/barbellatberkeley/?hl=en">Barbell @ Berkeley</a>, or creating Spotify playlists.<p/></div>

		<div><p>Last semester, I was the Design Director of <a href="https://bpr.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Berkeley Poltical Review</a> and a NLP researcher for Political Computer Science at Berkeley</p></div>
