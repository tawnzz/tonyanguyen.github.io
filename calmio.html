                                        The main goal of our project was to create a device that helps people with chronic stress or anxiety in
                                        daily life, or,
                                        any users who wanted to find a way to integrate user-controlled relaxation into their own life. We focused
                                        specifically
                                        on anxiety, the most prevalent mental disorder, with 40 million adults affected in the United States alone.
                                        We were
                                        surprised to find less than 40% of people with anxiety seek treatment, but realized that the financial and
                                        time cost of
                                        therapy is often prohibitive. In an age where people are endlessly connected through social media and smart
                                        devices,
                                        overexposure to criticism, fear of missing out, and social pressures exacerbates anxiety and stress.

                                    <p>
                                        We then set out to create a wearable—something that could be cost effective and easily accessible during
                                        daily life — that could be used discretely during anxiety or panic attacks.

                                        <p>With greater pressure to perform and the popularity of social media, life has become increasingly stressful. Modern
                                            times have seen rampant rises in cases of anxiety and depression. We live our lives constantly inundated by a
                                            barrage of
                                            notifications, deadlines, and far-reaching expectations. There’s no surprise that we’re known as the “anxious
                                            generation.” It seems that many aspects of the new media we interface with in our everyday lives play a role in
                                            perpetuating anxiety. As a result, we strived to create an interactive device that instead, helps people cope with
                                            anxiety and stress. In response, we created Calm.io.

                                            Calm.io is an interactive bracelet that mediates grounding practices for relaxation and bodily awareness, to ground
                                            users during stressful times. Designed to combat panic attacks for people with anxiety, Calm.io provides on-demand
                                            and
                                            discrete support. When the user feels overwhelmed, they can regain control by simply turning Calm.io’s dial. CalmIO
                                            breathes with users by discretely expanding and contracting on their wrist, guiding them to practice mindful
                                            breathing.
                                            In addition, users can also follow CalmIO’s interactive light display to reach a state of calmness– inhale slowly as
                                            it
                                            glows, then exhale as it dims. This breathing pattern can be made faster or slower as needed by simply adjusting the
                                            dial. Calm.io’s interaction focuses one’s attention on their body, calming their mind, all without announcing their
                                            current physiological and psychological status to the world.

                                        <h5>Hug Machine, Temple Grandin</h5>
                                        <p>One of our biggest inspirations was Temple Grandin, probably the most famous person with a public autism
                                            diagnosis and
                                            animal scientists. After finding the effective of physical pressure as a coping mechanism, she invented a
                                            hug machine, a
                                            device inspired by a cattle squeeze chute. The hug machine allows the user to apply controlled pressure to
                                            their sides
                                            with a simple rope mechanism. A study by Stephen Edelson, Meredyth Goldberg Edelson, David Kerr, and Grandin
                                            herself
                                            confirmed its efficacy in children with autism. As the hug machine is not particularly mobile or realistic
                                            to use in
                                            daily life, we thought of how we could transfer the same effects in a more feasible fashion.

                                    <h5>Like-A-Hug Jacket, Melissa Chow</h5>
                                    <p>
                                        Initially, we wanted to create a jacket that would help mediate anxiety by providing physical pressure on users,
                                        using
                                        inflation. However, we found that the work already existed in multiple domains. Melissa Kit Jow developed
                                        Like-A-Hug
                                        Jacket at MIT Media Lab. The jacket translates every Facebook ‘like’ into the sensation of a hug through
                                        inflation.
                                        This
                                        project was intended to furthering relationships between people despite physical distance. While the work forced
                                        us
                                        to
                                        pivot the form and mechanism of our wearable, it confirmed that this domain – comfort, physical sensation, and
                                        emotional
                                        mediation – was viable and compelling.
                                
                                    </p>

                                        <h5>T. Jacket, James Teh</h5>
                                        <p>
                                
                                            Another “hugging” jacket we found during research, the T. Jacket is specifically designed for children with
                                            mental
                                            disorders. The jacket has motion sensors in the sleeves that detect when the child is overstimulated. With
                                            the
                                            accompanying app, guardians can send controlled and adjustable hugs to the wearer to help calm them down. As
                                            a
                                            device
                                            that targets the same demographic, we used this product as more confirmation that using pressure as a coping
                                            mechanism
                                            would be helpful. We were inspired by the adjustability of the pressure and wanted to make sure whatever
                                            form of
                                            support
                                            our device provided could be tailored to the user’s needs. The jacket also has very targeted areas of
                                            pressure,
                                            which
                                            helped us think about where on the body our device should be used.

                                        <p>With greater pressure to perform and the popularity of social media, life has become increasingly
                                            stressful. Modern
                                            times have seen rampant rises in cases of anxiety and depression. We live our lives constantly
                                            inundated by a
                                            barrage of
                                            notifications, deadlines, and far-reaching expectations. There’s no surprise that we’re known as the
                                            “anxious
                                            generation.” It seems that many aspects of the new media we interface with in our everyday lives
                                            play a role in
                                            perpetuating anxiety. As a result, we strived to create an interactive device that instead, helps
                                            people cope with
                                            anxiety and stress. In response, we created Calm.io.

                                            Calm.io is an interactive bracelet that mediates grounding practices for relaxation and bodily
                                            awareness, to ground
                                            users during stressful times. Designed to combat panic attacks for people with anxiety, Calm.io
                                            provides on-demand
                                            and
                                            discrete support. When the user feels overwhelmed, they can regain control by simply turning
                                            Calm.io’s dial. CalmIO
                                            breathes with users by discretely expanding and contracting on their wrist, guiding them to practice
                                            mindful
                                            breathing.
                                            In addition, users can also follow CalmIO’s interactive light display to reach a state of calmness–
                                            inhale slowly as
                                            it
                                            glows, then exhale as it dims. This breathing pattern can be made faster or slower as needed by
                                            simply adjusting the
                                            dial. Calm.io’s interaction focuses one’s attention on their body, calming their mind, all without
